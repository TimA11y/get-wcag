# Get-WCAG

This is a cli tool that will scrape the WCAG 2.2 spec (https://ww.w3.org/tr/wcag22/) to retrieve all success criteria. It will then write a CSV file named "wcag.csv" that contains the success criterion number (such as 1.1.1), the short label for that criterion, the level of that criterion, and a link to the related understanding document.
